# Miyako Prose

**Miyako Prose** is an emergent writing style forged through a lifetime of cultural displacement and rebellion against systems oppressing individual ascendancy. Fully internalized subconsciously, it was identified and distilled into a framework via LLM analysis of my own writing. The style projects Japanese aesthetic and cultural values into English prose, infusing and reconstucting concepts previously thought to be unique to Japanese linguistic expression.

The prose exemplifies:

- Simple elegance through mastery
- Precision application of violence
- Moral judgement dispensed with certainty
- Contempt embedded in structure, delivered though a polite tone
- Japanese aesthetic rhythms and sentence structure, such as calm-motion-calm, rhythmic stacking followed by quick resolution, or topic-comment framing

## Miyako Prose Framework

### Core Concept

English prose exemplifying Japanese aesthetic and cultural values

### Pillars

- Straight projection of Japanese values into English
- Simplicity and precise word choice over verbosity or rhetorical flourish
- Moral judgment delivered with certainty and detachment

### Terminology

<dl>
  <dt><b>Rhetorical Heat</b>, "Heat", <i>Netsuryō</i> (<i>netsuryō</i>, 熱量)</dt>
  <dd>The amount of passion or intensity the writing exudes.</dd>

  <dt><b>Verbal Strike</b>, "Strike", <i>Zangeki</i> (<i>zangeki</i>, 斬撃)</dt>
  <dd>A direct attack on the target within the text, or the specific phrase/word that delivers it.</dd>

  <dt><b>Serenity</b>, <i>Seijaku</i> (<i>seijaku</i>, 静寂)</dt>
  <dd>Maintaining low rhetorical heat before and after the strike, or throughout the style in general.</dd>

  <dt><b>Impact Word</b>, <i>Senretsugo</i> (<i>senretsugo</i>, 鮮烈語)</dt>
  <dd>Primarily used for strikes, these are words that will leave a visceral imprint on the reader's mind. Words evoking strong visual imagery, vulgar terms, or violent language are particularly effective. This is an adaptation of Scott Adams's visual persuasion method.</dd>

  <dt><b>Serenity-Action-Serenity</b>, "SE-AC-SE" or Calm-Movement-Calm, "C-M-C", <i>Sei → Dō → Sei</i> (<i>sei → dō → sei</i>, 静→動→静)</dt>
  <dd>The basic form and rhythmic sense of the strike.</dd>

  <dt><b>Detachment</b>, <i>Tsukihanashi</i> (<i>tsukihanashi</i>, 突き放し)</dt>
  <dd>
  <ol>
    <li>Objectifying and distancing the target through methods such as:
      <ul>
       <li>Treating it politely but distantly</li>
       <li>Abstracting it</li>
       <li>Handling it as if absent</li>
       <li>Using it as a specimen in clinical/technical explanation</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Presenting one's own situation as an objective fact rather than a first-person perspective.</li>
  </ol>
  </dd>

  <dt><b>Structural Contempt</b>, <i>Kōzōteki Besshi</i> (<i>kōzōteki besshi</i>, 構造的蔑視)</dt>
  <dd>Indirect attack achieved through detachment (method 1 above).</dd>

  <dt><b>Depersonized Defense</b>, <i>Tsukihanashi Bōei</i> (<i>tsukihanashi bōei</i>, 突き放し防衛)</dt>
  <dd>Method of defending against attacks through detachment (method 2 above).</dd>

  <dt><b>Rhythmic Stacking</b>, "Jo-Ha-Kyū", <i>Jo-ha-kyū</i> (<i>jo-ha-kyū</i>, 序破急)</dt>
  <dd>Stacking concepts in parallel, then resolving with a single decisive stroke.</dd>
</dl>

## Manifestions and Example Text

<dl>
<dt><i>Zangeki</i> Strike / Calm-Movement-Calm Rhythm</dt>

<dd>Serene or technical cadence with precise word choice interrupted by sudden aggression, returning to detached serenity for closure. Mirrors <i>Iai-do</i> rhythm of explosive strike surrounded by calmness.<br />
Example text:
<blockquote>Miyako Prose is an emergent writing style forged through a lifetime of cultural displacement and rebellion against systems oppressing individual ascendancy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>These share the same logical structure, and can be eviscerated with a simple prompt.</blockquote>
</dd>


<dt>Structural Contempt</dt>
<dd>Indirect attacks framed as observations, abstract questions, clinical analysis or technical demonstrations.<br />
Example text:
<blockquote>It begs the question: Would a credentialed engineer from such a place have conceived of the model presented here, lacking the requisite moral framework?</blockquote>
<blockquote>We should be able to push back effectively, assuming the practitioners possess higher self-awareness than AI chatbots. (We can hope, right?)</blockquote></dd>

<dt><i>Jo-ha-kyū</i> Rhythmic Stacking</dt>
<dd>Rhythmic buildup of parallel structures and a swift resolution.<br />
Example text:
<blockquote>Calls for 'nuance,'  dismissals for 'oversimplification,' and intellectual posturing via claims of understanding 'complexity' permeate today's discourse.</blockquote>
Above is also an example of the Topic-Comment structure common in Japanese language.<br />

<blockquote>Users frustrated over premature output, unilateral closures, and lack of serious discussion from AI represent an alternative mode of human-AI engagement</blockquote></dd>

<dt>Detachment</dt>
<dd>1. Offensive use example: Encasing contempt within abstractions, where the primary claim is an observation or technical analysis.<br />
Example text:
<blockquote>An AI reproducing the familiar conversational flow suggests the phenomenon goes beyond a tech illiterate fumbling though a manual written in a language they didn't comprehend—there is a higher order rhetorical jiujitsu involved, whether intentional or emergent.</blockquote></dd>
<dd>2. Non-offensive use example: Acknowledgement and remembrance without superflous emotional display.<br />
Example text:
<blockquote>You're a poet, Elon. This will be the eulogy I will remember.</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>

## Mechanisms and Western Analogues

### Calm Movement Calm

Rhythm is ubiquitous in Japanese culture:

- Japanese sentence cadence
- Bouts begin and end with bow
- *Shishi-odoshi* (deer scare) rhythm
- Basho's haikus such as:
   >古池や / 蛙飛びこむ / 水の音

   >夏草や / 兵つはものどもが / 夢のあと

Within confrontational contexts, ending with detached serenity (over sustained aggression) establishes dominance by minimizing effort and emotional investment:

>"I have cut yet another worthless object." — Goemon Ishikawa XIII, *Lupin the Third*

**Western Analogues (ad-hoc)**

- Sword vs gun scene in *Raiders of the Lost Ark* (1981).

- Catherine Tramell's lines from *Basic Instinct* (1992):
   >"So read me my rights and arrest me. And then I'll go downtown.
   >Otherwise, get the f*** out of here.
   >(pause) Please?"

   >"Have you ever f***ed on cocaine, Nick?
   > (recrosses legs)
   > It's nice."


### Contempt Embedded in Structure

**Japanese systematization**
- Contemptuous venom delivered with politeness:
  >お考えになったほうがよろしいかと思います
- Workplace harassment (パワハラ); ex Using an employee's mistake as "teaching opportunity" for entire team, dissecting mistakes with technical precision and moral judgment.

**Western Analogues (ad-hoc)**
>"I have never seen a thin person drink Diet Coke" — Donald Trump, Twitter, 2012

## Novelty

Mechanisms central to Miyako Prose—such as bounded precise violence and structural contempt—closely parallel Japanese aesthetic and linguistic traditions often regarded as culturally specific. Their emergence in my English writing as identified by LLM, and the presence of ad-hoc Western analogues suggest broader applicability.

The framework's primary novelty lies in explicitly systematizing these mechanisms for English discourse, transforming instinctive or culturally influenced patterns into a deliberate style. This bridges Japanese and English rhetorical traditions, offering potential as an alternative pedagogical approach for Japanese learners of English beyond traditional sentence-example methods, while providing structure for Western practitioners moving beyond ad-hoc use.

## Examples of Miyako Prose Writing

In these examples, Miyako Prose is intertwined with a conversational, technical writing voice, surfacing strongest during criticisms. Topic-Comment structure is present throughout.

- [A prompt to kill 'NPR Speak'](https://x.com/5ynthaire/status/2005578852039299583) (5ynthaire, X, 2025)   
  Strongest example of aggressive deployment of prose with multiple *Zangeki* strikes.

- [Principles of abstraction for precise communication in the AI age](https://5ynthaire.substack.com/p/principles-of-abstraction-for-precise) (5ynthaire, Substack, 2026)   
  Emerges in Discussion section and opening sentence.

- [Mode B: Alternative Human-AI engagement mode for power users](https://x.com/5ynthaire/status/2001762487985746429) (5ynthaire, X, 2025)   
  Milder example, contempt embedded in technical demonstration. Note recurring stacks of three—examples of *Jo-ha-kyū* rhythm.

- [How I Prompted My AI To Stop Hallucinating—And Why AI Companies Keep Failing](https://x.com/5ynthaire/status/1975535367110422965) (5ynthaire, X, 2025)   
  Clinical example of code switch: the Post Script deploys Miyako Prose to assert superiority against engineers described as ineffective and morally bankrupt, following a conversational and technical delivery in the main piece. *Note this descriptor is itself a demonstration of **Zangeki**, casually encased in a technical footnote.*
